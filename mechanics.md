# Game Mechanics

## Spaces 
The game world consists of interconnected rooms that represent different locations in a post-apocalyptic city. These include:

Broken Down Apartment (starting location, base of operations)
Hospital & ICU (high-risk location for medical supplies)
Supermarket (source of food and supplies, guarded by a zombie)
Office Complex (contains Jisoo, who provides guidance)
Park (location of a military supply crate, initially blocked by a horde)
City Border (final escape point, requiring either a sacrifice or an M249 machine gun)
Rooms have descriptions that establish mood and provide contextual clues for survival.


## Time 
 Each turn is triggered by player actions like moving, examining, or interacting with objects and characters.
## Objects
The game includes various interactive objects, categorized as:

Inventory items: The player starts with a backpack containing essential supplies like a knife, pistol, and water bottle. Additional items (e.g., canned food, medical supplies, flashlight) can be acquired.
Fixed objects: Environmental elements like the medical supply crate in the park or the horde of zombies blocking certain paths.
Weapons: The knife allows melee combat, and the M249 machine gun enables a more powerful escape option.
Quest items: The canned food and water are required to gain Jisoo’s help in clearing the park.
Some objects have conditions tied to their usage (e.g., the backpack must be closed to prevent item loss).

## Actions
The game allows a variety of player actions, including:

Movement: Players can move between rooms using directional commands (e.g., go west).
Interacting with objects: Players can open and close the backpack, examine objects, or take items.
Combat: If the player tries to take canned food while a zombie is present, they must have a weapon to survive.
Character interactions: Players can ask Jisoo for help, choose who retrieves the hospital supplies, and influence the story based on their decisions.
## Rules 
Companions Follow the Player: Laura and David always move with the protagonist, reinforcing group survival dynamics.
Limited Carrying Capacity: The backpack has a critical role in inventory management, and leaving it open risks losing items.
Survivor Decision-Making: Choices regarding David (who can get infected) and Jisoo (who helps clear the park) impact the story.
Combat Requires a Weapon: Attempting to take food without a weapon results in the player’s death.
State of object: There are certain rules for each type of object. For alive object, there are (alive, dead), (infected, uninfected), (hurt, fine). An alive object can be in one each state from the pair. A room can be visited or not.

## Skill 
The game tests the player's ability to:

Manage resources effectively (e.g., securing supplies while minimizing risks).
Make strategic choices (e.g., deciding who should enter the ICU).
Plan survival routes (e.g., clearing paths through the city by obtaining key items).
## Chance 
all outcomes are deterministic, based on the player's choices. This means that success or failure depends entirely on decision-making rather than probability.
