# Reflection
List each change you made to your game, what piece of feedback the change is intended to address, and explain how the change addresses the feedback. Then describe any other changes you might want to make or any outstanding issues.
I added the ability to talk to character and dialogue based on different circumstances, which guides you to go in the direction of the game
I added some more ending to the game to make it more interesting
I added a new room, called the Deli store, where there will be another encounter
I added somne truth statement that represent state of a thing (alive, dead, infected, uninfected, visited, etc..) This aid with designing logic for the dialogue of the NPCS.
